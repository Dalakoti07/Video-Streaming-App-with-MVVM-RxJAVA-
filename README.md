# Video-Streaming-App-with-MVVM-RxJAVA 

An Android native mobile app copies TikTok ( https://www.tiktok.com ) mechanics and use https://livestreamfails.com videos as a source.

I have chosen the minimum API Level to be 21 since it provides approximately 85% device coverage. 

Network layer has been written using RxJava.
